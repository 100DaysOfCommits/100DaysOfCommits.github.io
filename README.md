# Kara does 100 Days of Commits
## Description

[100DaysOfCommits](http://100daysofcommits.github.io) is a challenge for developers to commit code for the next 100 days starting August 1, 2016. I have taken on this challenge, and intend on making the most of it! 

## What I'd like to do:
- [ ] Update the Readme on all my Repos
- [ ] Add the Styling to 100DaysOfCommits site
- [ ] Contribute to Tea with Strangers app
- [ ] Get a working prototype of my Nail Game App running
- [ ] Re-launch my blog
- [ ] Write something about what a good commit consists of
- [ ] Pair with people on their commits (or get people to pair with me)
- [ ] Add a calendar/map feature to connect people with pairs/spaces to code during 100DaysOfCommits
- [ ] Contribute to IfMe Mental wellness App

## What I've done:
