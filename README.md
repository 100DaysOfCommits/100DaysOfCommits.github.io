# 100DaysOfCommits.github.io

This github page acts as a home base for the #100DaysOfCommits project.

\#100DaysOfCommits is a 100 day long marathon where people commit to working on open source projects *not related to work*. The goal is to
create sustainable habits, grow as programmers, and give back to the open source community.

\#100DoC started as a Chicago PyLadies project but has grown to include several local partners.

- [PyData Chicago](https://twitter.com/PyDataChi)
- [Write/Speak/Code Chicago](http://www.writespeakcode.com/?utm_campaign=100DaysofCommits)

If you're interested in becoming a local partner, contact [@100Commits](https://twitter.com/100Commits) on Twitter. We're looking for people
and organizations to host in person and online hangout meetings, happy hours, code and coffee meetups, etc.

If you're interested in contributing additional **raffle prizes** or have other ideas about how to get involved,
please contact [Jess](100DaysOfCommits@gmail.com) via email.
