        <p>#100DaysOfCommits is a community project that's partnering with local coding meetups. We want to encourage people to get involved in Open Source and to start their own side projects. There's a raffle involved! </p>

<p>Every day for 100 days, people will post to Twitter and/or Instagram with the hashtag #100DaysOfCommits. </p>

<p>Simply include a screenshot of your commit message and a link to the repo in your Tweet/Instagram post. Anyone can submit any number of commits per day, but the goal here is building good, consistent habits. </p>

<p>A github account, an Instagram/Twitter account, and a desire to commit some code! </p>

<a id="what-counts-as-a-commit" class="anchor" href="#what-counts-as-a-commit" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What counts as a commit?</h1>

<p>You've committed and pushed some code to github that is <strong>not work related</strong>. Of course, you're on the honor system for that, but this is about getting out and doing your own thing. </p>

<p>The github contribution graph only counts commits that have been merged into master on a project you contribute to. We're not that stringent. We just want a screenshot of your commit message and a link to the repo you're working on. You can commit to a fork, a branch, whatever works as long as you're creating something! :) </p>

<p>As an incentive to get people involved, we'll be raffling off books donated to Chicago PyLadies from O'Reilly (THANK YOU O'REILLY!!!!) </p>

<p>We'll be doing three raffles. </p>

<h1>
<a id="raffle-rules" class="anchor" href="#raffle-rules" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Raffle rules</h1>

<ul>
<li>You're eligible for one raffle "ticket" for every day you commit you share on the hashtag in a given period.<br>
</li>
<li>You can share multiple posts in a day if you like, but you'll only get one "ticket" per day you commit </li>
<li>From 2016/8/1 to 2016/9/3 we'll be raffling off Think Python</li>
<li>From 2016/9/4 to 2016/10/7 we'll be raffling off Thoughtful Machine Learning</li>
<li>From 2016/10/8 to 2016/9/9 we'll be raffling off Think Stats </li>
<li>You must be willing to communicate with the Chicago PyLadies organizers via email about your shipping information to be eligible for the raffle. If your name comes up we'll "reserve" your raffle prize for seven days. If we haven’t gotten your information by the end of your reservation we will draw a new name.</li>
</ul>

Do I have to commit in any particular language?</h2>

<p>No! We think that you should just start getting involved in open source and creating your own projects. Python is our preferred language, but we want to see you getting out there and contributing to the community! </p>

<h2>
<a id="this-project-is-sponsored-by-chicago-pyladies-and-other-women-in-code-organizations-do-i-have-to-be-a-woman-to-participate" class="anchor" href="#this-project-is-sponsored-by-chicago-pyladies-and-other-women-in-code-organizations-do-i-have-to-be-a-woman-to-participate" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This project is sponsored by Chicago PyLadies and other women in code organizations. Do I have to be a woman to participate?</h2>

<p>No! We want people of all genders to participate, but people who identify as women or non-binary tend to contribute to open source less. We're using our platform to try to get more women involved. However, we'd love to see commits by people who identify as men as well. </p>

<h2>
<a id="i-dont-think-i-can-participate-for-100-straight-days" class="anchor" href="#i-dont-think-i-can-participate-for-100-straight-days" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I don't think I can participate for 100 straight days</h2>

<p>That's fine. If you're contributing anything at all between 2016/8/1 and 2016/11/9 we'd love to see you jump on the hashtag and share what you're doing. In fact, if you do, you'll be entered into a raffle for an O'Reilly book! </p>

<p>If you're interested in the project but think you won't be able to participate fully, consider jumping in on the hashtag and encouraging your friends. We're all about community building and encouragement. Let's help each other write more, better code!  </p>

<p>Maybe. We'd love to, but it's a matter of bandwidth. We're more likely to run future projects like this if we see community interest this time around. If you can’t participate, support your friends who can!</p>

<h1>
  <a id="meetup-groups" class="anchor" href="#meetup-groups" aria-hiden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Meetup Groups?</h1>

<p>We’d like to do informal check ins in Chicago at coffee shops or other community spaces every two weeks to help keep people motivated to write more code! If you’re in a different city and would like to do the same, let us know and we’ll help promote your meet up!</p>

<h1>
<a id="meetup-events" class="anchor" href="#meetup-events" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MeetUp Events</h1>

<p>We'll post future meetup events here as they are announced.</p>
